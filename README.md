# Task 1 â€“ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship. The objective was to clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset for use in machine learning models.

## Objective
To clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical columns, and removing outliers. This process prepares the dataset for machine learning modeling and improves overall data quality.


## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps performed 
- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, dropped `Cabin`)
- Encoded categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Standardized numerical features (`Age`, `Fare`)
- Detected and removed outliers in `Fare`
- Exported the cleaned dataset

## Files included
- `Task 1.py`: Python script with data cleaning steps
- `cleaned_titanic.csv`: Cleaned dataset
- `README.md`: Task overview
